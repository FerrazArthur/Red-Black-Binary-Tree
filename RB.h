/*
Projeto: Árvore binária balanceada rubro-negra
Autor: Arthur Ferraz
Propriedades:
-Todos os nós da Árvore Rubro-Negra são vermelhos ou pretos
-A Raiz é sempre preta
-Todo nó folha é preto
-Se um nó é vermelho, então seus filhos são pretos(não existem nós vermelhos consecutivos)
-Para cada nó, todos os caminhos até as folhas possuem o mesmo número de nós pretos

//Rhese are meant to be written by the one who knows the type of info it's going to be used by the redBlackTree, being this a generic library
void* getKey(Node* node);
/*
Input: Pointer to Node
Output: Node->info or NULL
Behaviour: Return a pointer to the variable that is going to be the key parameter.
*/

/*
Input: Two generic pointers
Output: Int
Behaviour: User define a method to compare the keys, given by getKey method, and the output should be as follows
    0 if they have the same weight;
    1 if info1 weight is bigger than info2;
    -1 if info1 weight is smaller than info2;

/*
Input: Pointer to info that the user has defined
Output: Void
Behaviour: Releases memory previous allocatted.

/*
Input: Pointer to Node
Output: Void
Behaviour: Print the key in node

Input: Pointer of pointer to Node(already in the tree),Pointer to Node that is Root of this tree, pointer to Node(to be inserted, must be red)

Behaviour: recursivelly searches the tree until find a NULL node, this case it's inserted, or find a node with the same weight. returns
    1 or 6 if it has inserted new Node
    0 if it has failed for unknow error
    2 if it has failed because newNode weight is already in tree

    0 otherwise
